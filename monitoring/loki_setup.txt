Loki Monitoring Setup (Conceptual + Practical)

Purpose:
--------
Collect and store logs emitted by Nomad batch jobs for debugging and auditing.

Architecture:
-------------
Nomad Task (stdout/stderr)
        ↓
Docker logging driver (json-file)
        ↓
Promtail (or Docker log scraper)
        ↓
Loki
        ↓
Grafana (query & visualization)

What is monitored:
------------------
- Application stdout (Hello, DevOps message)
- Application stderr (failures)
- Nomad allocation logs

Why this works for batch jobs:
------------------------------
Batch jobs emit finite logs and exit.
Loki is ideal for log aggregation without requiring long-lived services.

Basic Loki Verification:
------------------------
1. Start Loki:
   docker run -d -p 3100:3100 grafana/loki:2.9.3

2. Verify readiness:
   curl http://localhost:3100/ready

Expected:
---------
HTTP 200 when Loki is ready.

Notes:
------
In a production setup, Promtail would be configured to scrape:
- /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log
- Nomad allocation log directories

This project focuses on log flow understanding rather than full Grafana dashboards.

Note:
-----
On Docker Desktop (Windows), container log files are not directly accessible
to Promtail. To demonstrate log ingestion, Docker's Loki logging driver
was used to push logs directly to Loki.
