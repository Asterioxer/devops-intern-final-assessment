Grafana Loki Setup (Local)

1. Loki was started using Docker in single-binary mode:

docker run -d \
  --name loki \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  grafana/loki:2.9.3 \
  -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml

2. Loki runs on port 3100:
http://localhost:3100

3. Container logs (stdout/stderr) from Docker/Nomad workloads can be forwarded to Loki.

4. This setup demonstrates basic log aggregation and monitoring awareness
using Grafana Loki in a local DevOps workflow.
