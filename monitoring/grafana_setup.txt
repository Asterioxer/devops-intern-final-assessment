Grafana Visualization Add-on

Purpose:
--------
Provide visual inspection of logs emitted by Nomad batch jobs.

Components:
-----------
- Loki: log storage
- Promtail: log shipping from Docker
- Grafana: visualization

Why Grafana is included:
------------------------
While batch jobs do not require dashboards, Grafana enables:
- Log verification
- Debugging failed runs
- Demonstration of log flow understanding

Example Query:
--------------
{job="docker"} |= "Hello, DevOps"

This confirms:
- Container stdout is captured
- Logs are ingested into Loki
- Logs are queryable via Grafana
